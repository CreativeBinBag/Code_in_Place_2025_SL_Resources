# Code in Place 2025: Section Repository

  Hi, all, welcome to our Code in Place 2025 section! I'm excited to serve as your Section Leader and guide you through this incredible journey. My goal is to help you build strong coding skills, gain confidence, and collaborate effectively with your peers.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

To get up and running:

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/code-in-place-2025.git
   cd code-in-place-2025
   ```

2. **Install Stanford Karel**
   ```bash
   pip install stanfordkarel==0.2.7
   ```

   > **Note:** Installing `stanfordkarel` is required if you want to run the `main.py` files **locally**. Otherwise, you can copy and paste code into the Code in Place IDE and run it there without additional setup.

3. **Explore materials**
   - Open the slide decks in the `slides/` folder to review concepts and pseudocode development.
   - Check out the files in `code and walkthrough/` for implementations and detailed explanations.
   - Run `python main.py` in a session folder locally or paste the code into the CIP IDE to practice interactively.
